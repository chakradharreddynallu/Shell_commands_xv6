# Shell_commands_xv6
Introduction to UNIX System Programming Project**
**Project Overview:**
This repository hosts our submission for the system programming assignment, where we modify and extend the functionality of the xv6 operating systemâ€”a simple Unix-like teaching operating system. The focus of this project is to develop a deeper understanding of system calls, process management, and file handling by implementing and modifying traditional Unix commands within the xv6 environment.

**Project Components**
Modifying the ls Command: Enhance the ls command to hide hidden files by default, differentiate directories more clearly, and include an option to display hidden files.
Implementing the sleep Command: Create a sleep command that pauses the process for a specified number of ticks.
Implementing the uniq Command: Develop the uniq command to filter adjacent duplicate lines from a file, with additional functionalities like counting occurrences and specifying the number of characters to compare.
Implementing the find Command: Write a simplified version of the find command to locate files within a directory tree based on specific criteria such as name, type, and inode number.
Compilation and Testing
Ensure that all code compiles correctly using the provided Makefile, adhering to the project's specifications to avoid a penalty. Detailed instructions for building and running the modified xv6 are included in the repository.

**Additional Resources**
Project README: Contains detailed information about the environment setup, compilation instructions, and specific implementation details.
Screenshots and Outputs: Available in dedicated folders to demonstrate the functionality and expected outputs for each component.
Please refer to the individual files for specific modifications and the README for detailed project documentation.
